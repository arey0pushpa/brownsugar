							  <h2><a href="#item1"><strong>DynamoDB</strong></a></h2>
								<p>Amazon DynanoDB is a NoSQL database service offered by Amazon. This database serves as a key ingredient to Amazon Web Services. DynamoDB offers storage in terms of key and value pairs and spreads them out across servers in three different zones. One of the interesting facts is that the database itself can increase the number of servers when a demand for more traffic augments.</p>

							  <h2><a href="#item2"><strong>Big Table</strong></a></h2>
							  <p>Big Table is a compressed, high performance, and proprietary data storage system, developed under the guidance of Google. The database is primarily built using technologies like Google File System, Chubby Lock Service and SSTable. Although Google doesn&rsquo;t offer this database outside their system, users still can avail a part of it using Google App Engine. Supporters use this limited access just to add some extra speed to their searching. Hadoop users can incorporate Big Table into Accumolo and others can use it with Hypertable.</p>

							<h2><a href="#item3"><strong>Mongo DB</strong></a></h2>
							<p>Developed by the founders of DoubleClick, MongoDB formulates implementation of data in certain applications faster, as it stores data in the form of JSON like documents that are coalesced with dynamic schemas. This database has all the key features for a NoSQL database like key-value storage, JavaScript formatting, and flexible replication for sharding across nodes. Currently enterprises like MTV Networks, Craigslist, Disney Interactive Media Group, The New York Times and Etsy utilize Mongo DB technology. MongoDB is available under GNU General Public License, with language drivers available under Apache License.</p>

								<h2><a href="#item4"><strong>Redis</strong></a></h2>
							<p>Several kings and great lords are made mention of as being particularly
								fond of using the lancet. Peter the Great of Russia was remarkably fond of
								witnessing dissections and surgical operations. He even used to carry a
								case of instruments in his pocket. He often visited the hospitals to
								witness capital operations, at times assisting in person, and was able to
								dissect properly, to bleed a patient, and extract a tooth as well as one
							  of the faculty.</p>

							  <h2><a href="#item5"><strong>Couch DB</strong></a></h2>
							  <p>Apache Couch DB or simply Couch DB, is an open source database that completely embraces the web.Â  Couch DB is a NoSQL database that uses JSON documents to store data. Created in 2005 under former IBM Lotus notes developer Damien Katz, Couch DB was initially used as storage system for large scale databases till it became an Apache project in 2008. Still number of companies like the BBC and Credit Suisse uses Couch DB&rsquo;s dynamic content platforms to store configuration details for its marketing data framework. CouchDB is available under the Apache License 2.0.</p>

							  <h2><a href="#item6"><strong>Riak</strong></a></h2>
							  <p> Developed by Basho Technologies, Riak is a NoSQL database that mainly offers support to both JavaScript and Erlang. Inspired from Amazon&rsquo;s Dynamo Paper, Riak has a default backend storage, particularly for core shard-partitioned spacing. This database offers a flexible value store, which provides consistency to the data stored across a collection of nodes. The interesting fact in this storage process is that the data can grow whenever demand increases.							  </p>
							  <p>&nbsp;</p>
							  <p>							    Riak queries each node, gathers the results, and repeats the process for better outcome. The system also offers full-text indices for Solr-like searching and a control panel for watching over each cluster.</p>

								<h2><a href="#item7"><strong>Hadoop (HBase)</strong></a></h2>
							  <p>Hadoop, one of the biggest tools in database, has its own data store called HBase. This database primarily runs in an open source technology which supports NoSQL data stores. HBase uses Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The HDFS is designed to be a non-relational columnar distributed database. The mapping structure of Hadoop is well-suited for complicated computational jobs and queries.</p>
							  <p><br>
						      In 2010, Facebook acquired HBase to provide fault-tolerance storage to their databases. This acquisition gave them access to large quantities of spare data. Apache HBase is available under Apache License 2.0.</p>

								<h2><a href="#item8"><strong>Oracle NoSQL</strong></a><a href="#item2"></a></h2>
							  <p>The Oracle NoSQL Database is a distributed key-value database. It is designed to provide highly reliability along with scalability. This database stores sensitive data across a pre-set of systems that function as storage nodes. Oracle NoSQL offers better protection when compared to other databases as it can acknowledge the number of data being stored on one node also it can formulate the system to wait till the data is successfully backed up across the network.</p>
